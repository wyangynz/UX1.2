              This beautiful green, pink, and white striped plant is easy to
              care for and also easy to propagate!
            </span>

            <span>
              This cross-pollinated variety originated from the Netherlands. We
              are selling them in this petite size, but they are fast growers.
            </span>

            <span>
              The more light it gets, the more vibrant the color will be, so
              give this plant some good light. Some temporary direct sun is
              great!
            </span>

            <span
              >The plant you receive may be in either ceramic pot design, but
              you may request one in checkout notes and we will do our best to
              accommodate.</span

            <span>
